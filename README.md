## Introduction

Efficient waste management is a critical environmental concern. This project leverages deep learning to automate the detection and classification of plastic and paper objects. By identifying these objects, we aim to simplify sorting processes in recycling systems and contribute to sustainable practices.

---

## Features

- Detection of plastic and paper objects in images.
- Classification into respective categories.
- High precision and recall for robust predictions.
- Scalable model suitable for deployment in various environments.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch (select based on your implementation)
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lakshika-wijesundara/Plastic-and-Paper-Objects-detection-and-Classification.git
   cd Plastic-and-Paper-Objects-detection-and-Classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS
   env\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the dataset (details in [Dataset](#dataset) section).

---

## Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images of plastic and paper objects. 

- **Structure**:
  ```
  dataset/
  â”œâ”€â”€ train/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plastic/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ paper/
  â”œâ”€â”€ validation/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plastic/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ paper/
  â””â”€â”€ test/
      â”œâ”€â”€ plastic/
      â””â”€â”€ paper/
  ```

Ensure the dataset is placed in the `dataset/` directory.

---

## Model Training

1. Preprocess the data:
   - Resize images to uniform dimensions.
   - Normalize pixel values.

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Save the trained model for inference:
   ```bash
   python save_model.py
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the object detection and classification script:
   ```bash
   python detect_and_classify.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```

2. For batch processing:
   ```bash
   python detect_and_classify.py --folder path/to/folder
   ```

3. Visualize results in the `output/` directory.
